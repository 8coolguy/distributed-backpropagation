# Distrubuted Backpropagation

## Steps   
1. Create serial backpropagtion.

2. Distrubute onto many nodes in the WAVE center.

3. Use CUDA to improve calculation on each node.   

## Activation Functions   
Made a class to create activation functions. They have to inherir the Activation Function class and you have to define evalute and derivative.


## Serial Back Propagation   
Created a Layer class that will store the weights from layer i of size n to layer of j size m. Will do more work to implment the how inital weights are created.
